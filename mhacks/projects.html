Note there are like 3 or 4 major projects that aren't even open source. One is a massive (like 500 lines) compilation of scripts for cybersecurity. I posted it contingent on saying "Please don't fork!" because you'd get DQ'd in competition for copying scripts if you forked. It got forked immediately. Another is a cyber education platform but it's SQLi vulnerable at the moment so I didn't open source it yet until I have an appropriate workaround. Another is the CTF engine, a deployable platform for scoring a CTF. It's constantly breaking and slow, as the entire backend is bash. That being said, it runs. If I ever deployed it, I'd probably ensure it's a bit more solid in the backend area.

(HSTS helps if attacker is using HTTP, access policy helps but chrome extensions can make themselves excepted, etc). At the end of the day it was extremely successful and could probably be used in a training image. Requires developer mode.</td>

Keeping it lean and covert, but still usable. It's supposed to look like a very generic login form, but the username is converted to base64, then the PHP script decodes it and executes it in shell. Very basic but fun for CTFs. Intentionally basic so it's as convert as possible and I can write it down and bring it into competitions.</td>

I decided to expand it to stuff like automatic file carving and ultimately made a separate prettier platform called "CTF Toolkit" since nothing that process-intensive should occur on the client side.
